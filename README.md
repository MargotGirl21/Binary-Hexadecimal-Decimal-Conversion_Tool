ðŸ”¢ Number System Converter & Bitwise Operations

This program converts decimal, binary, and hexadecimal numbers into their respective numbering systems. It also supports bitwise operations such as XOR, OR, and AND.

ðŸŽ® Features

Convert between numbering systems: Decimal â†” Binary â†” Hexadecimal.

Bitwise operations: Perform XOR, OR, AND on binary numbers.

Efficient implementation: Uses Java's built-in methods and bitwise operators for fast calculations.

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

Language: Java

Core Components:

Operations.java - Implements number conversion and bitwise operations.
